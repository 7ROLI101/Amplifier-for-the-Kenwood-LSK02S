# Amplifier-for-the-Kenwood-LSK02S
This folder holds the amplifier that I am building for the Kenwood LSK-02S, which was a vintage speaker that my parents had in their basement. They weren't doing anything with it, so I decided to use it and create an amplifier for it.  

As of right now, I am learning about the different types of amplifier classes (A,B, and AB) and I am prototyping my own creations of the class A amplifier on a breadboard and some spare parts that I have at home. Because of this, I am limited in the parts that I can play around with right off the bat, so I am going to start off by learning about how to read the datasheets for the parts and seeing how each part I have in my circuit plays around with the rest of the parts that I have at home.  

Because of this, it is going to be obvious that my prototype for the class A is going to be very primitive at first. However, I will see what I can do with the parts that I have and go from there.  

After that, I will most likely create an actual circuit based on a 2 channel IC that I was lucky enough to have at home.
